            <h2> A History of Idaho</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; Native Americans People have lived in the land of Idaho for thousands of years.
				When the Europeans arrived there were two major Native American tribes in the region:
				the Nez Perce in the north and the Shoshone to the south. Both tribes lived similar lifestyles. For food they hunted animals such as deer and buffalo, fished the rivers,
                and planted corn and beans. <br>

                 They lived in tepees, which were easy to transport
                when they were following buffalo herds. Owyhee Mountains, Idaho from the USDA
                Europeans Arrive Because of its remote location, Idaho was one of the last of
                the lower 48 U.S. states to be visited by Europeans. In 1805, explorers Lewis
				and Clark entered Idaho on their way to the Pacific Ocean. They met with both
				the Shoshone and the Nez Perce peoples. Their guide was Sacagawea, a Shoshone 
				Indian they had met in North Dakota. Soon after, fur traders moved into the area
				including Andrew Henry who built Fort Henry in 1810.<br>

                &emsp; Early Settlers Throughout
				the early 1800s more settlers came to Idaho. They included missionaries, fur
				traders, minors, and farmers. Many settlers traveled along the Oregon Trail
				which went through southern Idaho. Some settlers stopped along the way and
				made their home in Idaho. The first permanent settlement in Idaho was Franklin,
				which was established by the Mormons in 1860. The State Capitol building in
				Boise,Idaho by Jon Sullivan Becoming a State For many years, the region that
				included Idaho was claimed by both the United States and Britain. In 1846,
				the area officially became part of the United States through the Oregon Treaty
				with Britain. 
				It joined the Oregon Territory in 1848. In 1853, Oregon became
				its own territory and Idaho became part of the Washington Territory. Idaho
				grew in population after gold was discovered in 1860 and, in 1863, became
				its own territory called Idaho Territory.<br><br>
