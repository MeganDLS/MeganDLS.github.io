    <h2>The Site Purpose</h2>
    <p> The purpose of this site is to allow the client to display local community events and the weather for a few
        cities in Southern Idaho.
        Preston, Soda Springs, and Fish Haven will be the three cities showcased. The goal is to provide
        updated weather for different events. Community members will be able to post and read about
        events happening near them. There will be a gallery of pictures and contest once a month for
        a free ticket based on the best picture. The objectives would include the ability to connect as a community by
        supporting local businesses and
        providing an opportunity to meet.</p>

    <h2>Domain Name</h2>
    <p> The available domain name I found is "tutlookslikeraintut.com"</p>
    <img src="images/domain.png" alt="screen shot of the domain name found" />
    <h2>Logo</h2>
    <p> The logo is an umbrella for now. I think I would like to add something to show other events are happening. Maybe
        in the background.</p>
